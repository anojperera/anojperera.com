I have been in IT / Hardware development for over 20years and over the years _greping_ the internet for how tos, its never quite the same.
So I thought I'll write them down here for benefit of others and or me for that matter.

Bit about me. I studied Aerospace Engineering and
has master's degree in Advanved Manufacturing Systems. Since leaving university I landed on a job which involved industrial and office
automation.

My technology journey started with an _ZX Spectrum_ writing in basic, long time ago, after leaving university, landanded on a job
which involved industrial and office automation in VBA excel Macros then moved on to do more in Visual Basic, leaned about _Microsoft's COM_.
Around about this time, I was getting more involved in C++. LAMP stack was popular at this time also it provided an easy solution deploy to one
place and available to everyone problem. I couldn't quite get my C++ libraries to work with PHP so I ended up porting most of it to C and learned
how to write PHP custom modules and the rest is history. I grew an instant liking to the C language. Dunes have shifted since those days, now I market
myself as a full stack cloud developer. I have also developed and published iOS applications and really enjoy working with `LLVM` compiler. I am not
a `java` developer, I've avoided it like the plague.

## Tech stack

I use Python, Typescript / Javascript with React in the FE. In the backend prefer to use serverless infrastructure as `AWS API Gateway, Lambda and Step Functions`.
Although sometimes its not always possible. I've also used `ECS / EKS on AWS Fargate`. For simpler applications I've used `serverless` framework for
writing infrastructure as code but my preferred choice would be `terraform`. I've ignored docker for a long time but recently got the hang of it and really
begun to love it.
